Submission is the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) application that managed submissions for the [2018 Bird Audio Detection challenge](http://dcase.community/challenge2018/task-bird-audio-detection). 
It is wrapped in a Docker container, largely inspired by (https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-flask-docker), including an nginx and an uwsgi servers managed by supervisord.

The main features include:
* Basic user management (register/login/logout)
* Admin panel to manage admin users and competitions
* Automatic score computation from uploaded submission files
* Score visualisation with Google Charts

Submission is aimed at being improved by the community to offer a free and generic Kaggle-like challenge platform. Any contribution is welcome!

# INSTALLATION
 
### 1 - Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/julj/submission.git
$ cd submission
```
 
### 2 - Create the db backup volume to be mounted
`$ mkdir db_backup`

### 3 - Run [postgres container](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) and mount database to host volume
```
$ docker run \
    --name submission_db \
    -v $(pwd)/db_backup:/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    -e POSTGRES_USER=myuser \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=submission_db \
    -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
    -d postgres
```
 
### 4 - Build flask app
`$ docker build -t submission web/`
 
### 5 - Run flask app and link to database container
`$ docker run --name submission --link submission_db:submission_db -p 5455:80 -v $(pwd)/web/submission:/myapp -d submission`
 
### 6 - Initialize db and migrate (https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
```
$ docker exec submission flask db init
$ docker exec submission flask db migrate
$ docker exec submission flask db upgrade
```
 
### 7 - Enjoy
Now the app is available at localhost:5455

### 8 - More stuff in case you want to modify the app

#### Logs
The logs of the app (nginx, uwsgi, Flask errors...) can be seen with
`docker logs <submissioncontainerid>`

where `<submissioncontainerid>` can be seen with

`docker ps`

#### Migrations
If you change the models, make sure to run the migrations, which are managed by [Flask-Migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

#### Supervisord
After any change, restart uwsgi:

`docker exec submission supervisorctl restart uwsgi`

 
# ADMINISTRATION
 
 The administration panel can be found at localhost:5455/admin.
 
### 1 - Login using the default admin user
email: admin@example.com
password: changeme
 
### 2 - VERY IMPORTANT: change the admin password

This can be done by editing the admin user data in localhost:5455/admin/user/.
 
### 3 - Create a competition

**WARNING: because of short time constraint, some datasetid have been hardcoded [here](https://github.com/julj/submission/blob/8f9a0add4eb543f9d625b36998f6cc682b079caf/web/submission/submission/views.py#L115).**




Competitions can be created from localhost:5455/admin/competition/. 
For each competition a ground truth must be uploaded, in the format: 
 
`<id>,<datasetid>,<detection probability>`
 
where `<id>` is the identifier of the test file, `<datasetid>` is self-explanatory and `<detection probability>` is self-explanatory too (usually 0 or 1 for the ground truth). 
 
Example: 
 
```
$ cat groundtruth.csv
file1,dataset1,0 
file2,dataset1,0 
file3,dataset2,1 
file4,dataset2,0 
...
```

### 4 - Scores
User scores can be seen graphically at localhost:5455/scores.

Submissions ca be seen in the administration panel at localhost:5455/admin/submission/.

The submission files are stored in the path specified in web/submission/instance/config.py.
